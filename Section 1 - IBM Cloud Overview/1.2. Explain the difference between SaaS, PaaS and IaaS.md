# Explain the difference between SaaS, PaaS and IaaS

## 1.2.1 Describe the usage of IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) and its benefit.
“IaaS,” is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the internet, and on a pay-as-you-go basis.
### 1.2.1.1 Server, Storage, Networking:
- **Server**:  IaaS providers will manage large **physical data centers** required to power the various layers of abstraction on top of them and that are made available to end users over the web.
- **Storage**: 1. **Block storage**, sometimes referred to as block-level storage, is a technology that is used to store data files on Storage Area Networks (SANs) or cloud-based storage environments. 2.**File storage**, also called file-level or file-based storage—is a hierarchical storage methodology used to organize and store data on a computer hard drive or on network-attached storage (NAS) device. 3. **Object storage**, often referred to as object-based storage, is a data storage architecture for handling large amounts of unstructured data. **Object storage has thus become the most common mode of storage in the cloud given that it is highly distributed (and thus resilient), it leverages commodity hardware, data can be accessed easily over HTTP, and scale is not only essentially limitless but performance scales linearly as the cluster grows.**  
- **Networking**: Traditional networking hardware, such as routers and switches, are made available programmatically, typically through APIs. 

### 1.2.1.2 Benefit:
- Pay-as-you-Go: Unlike traditional IT, IaaS does not require any upfront, capital expenditures, and end users are only billed for what they use.
- Speed: With IaaS, users can provision small or vast amounts of resources in a matter of minutes, testing new ideas quickly or scaling proven ones even quicker.
- Availability: Through things like multizone regions, the availability and resiliency of cloud applications can exceed traditional approaches.
- Scale: With seemingly limitless capacity and the ability to scale resources either automatically or with some supervision, it’s simple to go from one instance of an application or workload to many.
- Latency and performance: Given the broad geographic footprint of most IaaS providers, it’s easy to put apps and services closers to your users, reducing latency and improving performance.
